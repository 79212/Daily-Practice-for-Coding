# Data Manipulation

This is a record of all my coding practice including Data Manipulation, Data Structure and Algorithm, Data Visualization.

This is a list of all the practice:
* [Pandas & Numpy practice](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/Data%20Manipulation%20Practice/Pandas%20%26%20Numpy%20Practice)
* [Python(pandas) codes for implementing SQL queries](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/Data%20Manipulation%20Practice/Python%20codes%20for%20implementing%20SQL%20queries)
* [Other techniques & practice](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/Data%20Manipulation%20Practice/Other%20techniques%20%26%20practices) 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For Data Pandas & Numpy and Implementing SQL queries practice, `pandas` and `numpy` packages are required.

For Data Other techniques, `wordcloud` packages are required.

#### Install packages

Personally, I recommend to use anaconda which is easy to manage the packages.
* [anaconda free download link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

After installing anaconda, you can easily install python packages in terminal. 
```
conda install package_name
```

#### Load packages
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyploy as plt
import seaborn
```
